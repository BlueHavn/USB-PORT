This program is designed using Java to detect when a USB device is inserted or removed from the computer and, if it is inserted, to reset the device.

1. Download Java Development Kit (JDK): This is a software development kit that includes the tools you need to compile and run Java programs. Download it from [Here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
2. Download A text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to write and edit your Java code. Some popular IDEs for Java include Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans.

**Once you have these tools set up, you can follow these steps to run the code:**

1. Download the code and open it into your text editor or IDE.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.

```java
        //Compile the code using this command and pressing Enter.
        javac USBReset.java
```
3. Run the program

```java
       //Run the program using this command.
       java USBReset
```

**The program should start running and will continue to run until you stop it. You can stop the program by pressing CTRL+C in the terminal or close command prompt.**
